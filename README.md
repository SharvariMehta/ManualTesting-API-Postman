## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates **end-to-end SOAP API Testing** using **SOAP UI** for the `CurrencyName` operation from the public WSDL:

👉 [CountryInfoService – CurrencyName](http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?op=CurrencyName)

The API takes a **Currency ISO Code** (e.g., `USD`, `INR`, `EUR`) and returns the **currency name** (e.g., *United States Dollar*, *Indian Rupee*, *Euro*).

## ✨ Highlights

* 📑 Designed a **Test Plan** (Objective, Scope, Strategy, Entry/Exit Criteria, Risks, Deliverables)
* 🧪 Created **detailed Test Cases** (positive, negative, boundary, schema, performance)
* 📊 Maintained a **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** ensuring 100% coverage
* ⚡ Validated **SOAP XML Request/Response** against WSDL schema
* ⏱️ Performed **functional, negative, and performance testing** in **SOAP UI**
* 📝 Documented **defect reporting & mitigation strategies**

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

✔ **Positive** → Valid ISO codes (`USD`, `INR`, `EUR`) return correct names  
❌ **Negative** → Invalid (`XXX`), Empty (`""`), Special chars (`@#$`) inputs  
⚡ **Boundary** → Long strings (100 chars), Sequential requests (reliability)  
📐 **Schema** → Response matches WSDL contract  
⏱️ **Performance** → Response time ≤ 2 seconds
